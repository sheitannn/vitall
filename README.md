# Artefact: What is VITAL

Vital is a magazine focused on experimental electronic music. It started in 1987 as magazine on paper. It's simple xeroxed form ensured a free copyright and everybody was encouraged to make copies and distribute them freely. Up until 1995 44 issues were made and with the arrival of the Internet, Vital changed into a pure e-mail review newsletter and since then it appears weekly. Still as a free service and still without copyright. [Here](http://vitalweekly.net/) is the current vital website. Some of the issues are also archived in [IISG Amsterdam](https://hdl.handle.net/10622/B243EE91-F43C-4C88-9B1D-9E346CA715BA).

# Research

Main part of our research is interview with author of VITAL Frans De Waard recorded on 11th March 2020 in Nijmegen. In the interview he talks about background of the magazine, his life and many other things regarding the magazije itself. You can find the transcribed interview here: [interview](https://www.notion.so/interview-transcribe-6b2df57bd7154ccfa9b2070784b82857).



# Transcoding

We decided to concentrate on the **first 10 issues** which are published in the time span of almost **3 years – 1987–1989**. We want to create a digital alternative containing the magazine itself + all other contents that were difficult to access at the time for the readers – mainly the reviewed music.



- We want to create an environment which allows you to browse the content and understand its origins.

- The digital tool we would like to create allows us to transcode the 3 main contents of the magazine into a new type of master copy – one that you can browse online. And experience the music itself.

- By making this environment we want to connect the viewer/listener more closely to the person who is committing his life to creating this magazine. We want to expose the nature of the magazine which is consequently the nature of Frans De Waard.

  

This environment will be accesible via website that will consist of three main parts:



### TOOL #1 : 

#### Description

Printing tool for the viewers of the website to be able to reproduce the physical magazine at home, and spread it further to other potential viewers. Here is [link](https://www.notion.so/VITAL-ISSUES-b97881dc1241496485d10541d3aacde2) to pictures of physical magazine, which will be used for the printing tool.

#### Methods

First we took images of the artefact simply with a Smartphone. Later we used the scanning machines in the IISG archive to get better scans. And later we got cleaned up scans from Frans de Waard himself. We used the text recognition within Adobe Acrobat to extract raw text from the scans. Then we pasted this text into Notion software. We created a printing tool in Atom coding software by using html, python, javascript, css and less languages.

#### Results

Here will be a link to the finished website.



### TOOL #2 : 

#### Description

Interactive experience which jumps the gap between the physical magazine and the music. It is to embed the graphics of the magazine with information – the music so that when you hover on them you can hear music associated to the images taken from the original printed magazine.

#### Methods

Same as **TOOL #1** for getting the scans. Then we extracted and edited all the graphics with photoshop. First we searched for the music in [discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) page and then on youtube and we used a Youtube to mp3 [converter](https://ytmp3.cc/en13/) to get the audio files. We created a interactive playlist in Atom coding software by using html, javascript and css.

#### Results

Here will be a link to the finished website.



# Mastercopy – Distribution

Reproduction and distribution was and still is very important part of the magazine concept. The original version was sent to subscribers via post. These people received a so called **Mastercopy** and were encouraged to continue distributing the magazine by making copies of the Mastercopy. Today Vital is sent to subscribers via e–mail.

- We want to create a distribution network by using torrents – a peer-to-peer sharing system. Once we complete our transcodings, we want to package them into one file and make them available to everyone via torrent. Thus, maintaining the principle of a master copy. Everyone will become part of the chain.

# Questions/problems

Before the COVID–19 situation started we wanted to make physical transcodings, which would create physical environment. It is the life work of someone and creating a physical/ tangible space transcodes the paper magazine into more immersive experience as it is for the person making it. By making this environment we wanted to connect the viewer/listener more closely to the person who is committing his life to creating this magazine.

Now the task is to transform this environment into digital space.
